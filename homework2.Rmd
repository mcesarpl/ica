This is an [R Markdown](http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com) Notebook. When you execute code within the notebook, the results appear beneath the code. 

Try executing this chunk by clicking the *Run* button within the chunk or by placing your cursor inside it and pressing *Ctrl+Shift+Enter*. 



```{r}
library(AppliedPredictiveModeling)
data(solubility)
library(lattice)
library(e1071)
library(caret)
```

pre process


```{r}
notfps = names(solTrainX)[209:228]
train_X <- solTrainX[,notfps] + 1
test_X  <-  solTestX[,contVars] + 1
```


```{r}

solPP <- preProcess(train_X, method = "BoxCox")
solTrainTransX <- predict(solPP, train_X)
solTrainTestX <- predict(solPP, test_X)
```

Junta os preditores e as variÃ¡veis transformadas

```{r}
solTrainTransX <- cbind(solTrainX[1:208],solTrainTransX)
solTrainTestX <- cbind(solTestX[1:208],solTrainTestX)
```


```{r}
skewness(solTrainXtrans$MolWeight)
skewness(solTrainTransX$MolWeight)
```



Add a new chunk by clicking the *Insert Chunk* button on the toolbar or by pressing *Ctrl+Alt+I*.

When you save the notebook, an HTML file containing the code and output will be saved alongside it (click the *Preview* button or press *Ctrl+Shift+K* to preview the HTML file).

The preview shows you a rendered HTML copy of the contents of the editor. Consequently, unlike *Knit*, *Preview* does not run any R code chunks. Instead, the output of the chunk when it was last run in the editor is displayed.
